🚀 Project Overview

Project Title

Smart Health Reminder & Gamification App with Ultimate Alarm Clock Integration

Abstract

This project aims to develop a Flutter-based health and wellness app that combines:
✔️ Smart reminders for hydration, posture, exercise, and meditation
✔️ Gamification (points, achievements, challenges, leaderboards)
✔️ Ultimate Alarm Clock Integration for shared alarms and sleep-based wake-upsBy making health habits engaging and easy to follow, the app encourages users to stay consistent with their well-being.

Why This Project?

People struggle to maintain healthy routines due to busy schedules and lack of motivation.

Gamification increases adherence to wellness activities.

Integrating reminders with sleep tracking enhances user health holistically.

The project can serve as a foundation for future AI-powered health assistants.

🔧 Technical Details

📂 Project Architecture

Follows a clean architecture approach:

Data Layer: Models (User, HealthData, Achievements, Reminders), SharedPreferences for storage.

Business Logic Layer: Providers (User, Health, Gamification, Reminder), Notification & AI services.

Presentation Layer: UI Screens (Home, Reminders, Achievements, Challenges, Profile), Reusable widgets.

📜 Core Features

✅ User Authentication: Secure login, health metrics calculation (BMI, calories).✅ Health Tracking: Water intake, step counting, guided meditation, posture checks.✅ Gamification: Points system, achievements, challenges, leaderboards.✅ Smart Reminders: Custom schedules, intelligent notifications.✅ Ultimate Alarm Clock Integration: Shared alarms, sleep-quality-based wake-ups.✅ AI Integration (Planned): Personalized recommendations, NLP for user input, health pattern insights.
